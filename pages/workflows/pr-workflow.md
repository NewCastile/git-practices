# Fluid PR Workflow

This workflow is one where no changes are published neither to `main` or `development`.
Your branch is going to be ahead from both of these.

# Scenario

You've created a new branch from a up-to-date version of the `development` branch
and no one other than you is working on this page. None of the other members of your team
will make changes that can possibly conflict with yours.

You make the changes, commit those changes, make a good PR to `development` and wait for your
reviewer to merge those changes.
